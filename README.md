# Cleaning-Robot-Game-

Designed a game with an interface using the Qt environment. <br />
•	Built a “Cleaning Robot Game” using C++ where two robots compete who cleans the room first. <br />
•	Maintained a health variable that decreases when robots bump into each other. <br />
•	Generated 3 dirt items in the room at random locations using a random function. <br />
•	Created a score variable that increases every time the robot collects dirt. The one with the most dirt items collected wins. <br />

Project is based on the videos of Abdullah Aghazadah <br />
