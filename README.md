# Cleaning-Robot-Game-

Designed a game with an interface using the Qt environment.
•	Built a “Cleaning Robot Game” using C++ where two robots compete who cleans the room first.
•	Maintained a health variable that decreases when robots bump into each other.
•	Generated 3 dirt items in the room at random locations using a random function.
•	Created a score variable that increases every time the robot collects dirt. The one with the most dirt items collected wins.

Project is based on the videos of Abdullah Aghazadah
